## About

A repository dedicated towards learning GoLang Syntax by making simple terminal based game. The idea is to apply concepts learned from Go By Example into a the game instead of just copying the examples and trying to learn from them. Below is a checklist of concepts that have been used in the game. 

## Build

```bash
go run main.go
go build
```
